# google_timeline
Fetch specific KML's from your google timeline

This is WIP in progress.

* For the moment I learned some basic go as I never written something in golang before
* Got the POC working > For fixed 2018 I can chose a month and loop over all days in that month to download the KML's.


Next up:

* Learning how to properly structure a go project
* Making it a proper configurable and testable ;)
